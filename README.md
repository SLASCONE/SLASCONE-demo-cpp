## Development Container

This project leverages a development container (`devcontainer`) to establish a consistent and reliable development environment. The devcontainer is pre-configured with all required dependencies, ensuring an optimal setup for running and contributing to the project. To utilize the development container, open the project in Visual Studio Code and choose the option to reopen it within the container. This approach guarantees that all dependencies are properly installed and configured.

## Connecting to your SLASCONE environment

The application connects to the official SLASCONE environment. In order to connect to your SLASCONE environment, adjust the values of Helper.cpp.
